# Blog, Final Version

Easily navigable, minimalist blog. I'm using this blog to share my story about transitioning into code from teaching.
- Front-end: EJS, JS
- Back-end: Node, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Deployed [here](https://hidden-atoll-31231.herokuapp.com/) with Heroku.

**What I enjoyed while building this app:** There were two big things that I really enjoyed about building this project. The first was that I was able to do 90% of the work on my own while only using documentation to confirm that I understood back-end functionality -- especially when it comes to integrating a database. I also really enjoyed seeing the clear relationship between the older EJS templating and more recent React components. 

**What I struggled with while building this app:** Styling and responsiveness -- I had assumed that because I used Bootstrap to style my blog, it would be a lot easier to build responsiveness, but it took quite a bit of work and I'm still not entirely thrilled with how this displays on a mobile interface. 

**Things I learned through building this app:** I'm quite surprised that I find back-end work to be almost more intuitive than front-end. I always thought I would prefer front-end and styling, and while I definitely find front-end to be really interesting, I like building the connections and functionality from the back-end quite a bit. Mongoose really makes Mongo connection very easy as well!

*Built as part of a series of final projects for The London App Brewery bootcamp's class of July 2022*
